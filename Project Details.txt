1) Signals:

SignalStoreService with counter, items, set/update/delete.

2) HTTP services returning Observables:

ApiService with of(...).pipe(delay()).

3) Reactive forms:

ReactiveFormDemoComponent using FormBuilder, validators.

4) Template-driven forms (ngForm):

LoginComponent with ngForm, ngModel, template refs.

5) New control flow:

@if, @else, @for, @switch, @empty in several templates.

7) Async pipe:

items$ | async, user$ | async, loading$ | async, etc.

8) Subjects:

Subject, BehaviorSubject, ReplaySubject in SignalStoreService.

9) RxJS operators:

debounceTime, delay, switchMap, concatMap, mergeMap (flatMap), exhaustMap.

10) Events:

(click), (keyup), (change), (blur), (mouseover), drag/drop events, (ngSubmit) etc.

11) Lazy-loaded modules & routing + guard:

AuthModule, DashboardModule, DataModule loaded via loadChildren with AuthGuard.

12) NgRx:

Feature state with primitive (globalCounter) and object (items) + Effects for API loading + loading/error state.

13) Custom pipes:

HighlightPipe, RoleListPipe.

14) HTTP interceptor:

AuthInterceptor adding Authorization header based on MSAL mock.

15) MSAL-like auth + authorization:
